# Python LSTM Implementation

This directory contains a minimal seq2seq LSTM model in Python using PyTorch.  
- `model.py`: Defines the encoder, decoder, and seq2seq.  
- `preprocess.py`: Reads and processes the parallel data.  
- `train.py`: Trains the model.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies.
2. Run `train.py`.
